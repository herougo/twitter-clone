# Twitter Clone

A social media app which is essentially a clone of twitter.

## Functional Features

- login, signup, and logout
- create, view, like, dislike, and reply to posts
- home page with a feed of posts from accounts you're following
- profile page with a user's information (e.g. posts, followers/following, etc)
- real-time messaging

## Why Build This?

I wanted to build a full-stack application from scratch and twitter caught my eye because of the UI and the real-time messaging aspect. I also wanted more practice with Node.js, CSS, and React.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js (JavaScript), Express.js, MongoDB, supertest
- Frontend: JavaScript, CSS, React
- Full Stack: Socket.io

## Best Practices Used

- **RESTful API** for scalability, readability, etc
- **Repository Pattern** for decoupling data logic from the service logic
- **Responsive CSS** for adapting to multiple screen sizes gracefully
- **Separation of Logic into Service Classes** for separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection Class** for repository and service management
- **Organized and Scalable Folder Structure** following https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-folder-structure/

## Testing / Quality Assurance

Backend testing is done with supertest.
